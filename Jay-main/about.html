        <p>Growing up I loved to figure out how things operate, I took apart my toys to see how they moved. In highschool I was pretty poor so any phone I had, if it were to break I would fix it and that kinda turned into a business of its own. By the time I was a sophmore our schools wouldn't let us watch youtube or go on any sites they deemed counterproductive. In an effort to break the security measures I really fell in love with computer programming. Fast foward years later I started working with a land surveying company and boy were they behind and so I thought, "I could do somoething about this". With the help from a coworker we embarked on our journey at Case Western Reserve to become full stack developers</p>
